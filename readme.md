# FAT32 Minimum Security Standard
## About
The FAT32 Minimum Security Standard comprises of adopting both sets of controls from the AICPA SOC 2 Type 2 and NCSC Cyber Essentials certification to enable organisations to achieve compliance in both standards and ensure maximum security.

## Why we created the Minimum Security Standard
We created the standard on the basis of the feedback we've had from customers who are being asked to achieve multiple standards and the difficulty of doing both. With the FAT32 Minimum Security Standard, organisation's customers can be assured that their supplier is upholding the highest level of security whilst reducing the cost and time to implement it.
